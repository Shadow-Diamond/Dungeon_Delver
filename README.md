# WELCOME TO DUNGEON DELVERS
## There are a few things to know before starting your Four-Player journey through the dungeons below
### First: Datapacks
The Datapack (dungeon_delver) is absolutely required to play this minigame, as without it nothing will work.
### Second: Resource Packs
The Resource pack (DungeonDelvers) has custom textures which are needed for the minigame to make sure it spawns unique looking items, like coins.
### Third: World (Not Yet Added)
The World is where you will Play Dungeon Delvers, and of course some other minigames. The only thing you will really need to install is the resource pack, unless I can find a way that forces resource packs to be enabled when entering a world.
### Finally: Everything Else!
Dungeon Delvers is aimed to be a 4 player VS minigame with little PVP. Your goal is to collect coins and magic dust throughout the dungeon, making your way deeper into it. There will be traps, enemies, and parkour as you traverse these dangerous dungeons.
Between games, players can buy items for their next run with the coins they have collected in the dungeon. Players can also add Cards to the game, which will randomly apply buffs to players (One or all, to be determined).
The further down the dungeon you go, the more chances of recieving loot, but the bigger chances of death! Between each level, players can choose to deposit their items, but that takes them all the way back to the first level of the dungeon, or continue further down, risking it all.
Good luck, Dungeon Delvers, and have fun.
